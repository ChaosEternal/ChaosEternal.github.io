"""Render-spec builders for the source table, TOC and file header (#451).

ONE source of truth for the row/TOC markup shape.  The same functions are
consumed by:

- the server-side Jinja render (``templates/view.html`` via ``/view``), and
- the client-side soft swap, which loads this file verbatim into the warm
  Pyodide runtime (``GET /py/view_specs.py``).

Keeping both paths on the same code makes it structurally impossible for a
swapped-in file to render differently from a fresh ``/view`` — the drift these
used to be two copies of lived in ``static/nav_logic.js``.

Two constraints shape this module:

- **No imports.**  Pyodide loads it as a bare file next to ``renderer.py``,
  with nothing but micropip'd ``markdown-it-py`` in the environment.
- **camelCase spec keys.**  These dicts cross the WASM bridge and are consumed
  verbatim by DOM code in ``static/app.js``; they are a JS-facing contract, not
  Python-internal data.

The ``id="L{start_line}"`` anchor built here is what comments are attached to.
It must not change (cf. the 2026-07-22 comment-loss incident).

    one block, which is how a real Marp deck writes its directives.  Only
    whitespace may separate them.

    Each comment closes at its *own* first ``-->``.  Scanning to the last one

    its prose as directive text, and ``slide_specs`` would drop that prose off
    the deck (MS-607).  Searching from index 4 also rejects ``<!-->``, where
    the opener and the closer would otherwise share characters.  Returning
    ``None`` rather than ``[]`` keeps ``<!---->`` — a real, empty comment —

    ``renderer._COMMENTS_ONLY_RE`` is the same test, spelled

    comment text, which is why a real Marp deck used to render its own
    directives as visible body text on the slide.

    A block counts as a directive block only when it is a ``paragraph``, is
    entirely HTML comment, every line inside those comments reads
    ``key: value``, and at least one key is a directive this module acts on.
    The lines are pooled across the run, so a later comment can carry the
    layout and a single non-directive line anywhere disqualifies the whole
    block — the same all-or-nothing rule a multi-line comment already had, and
    for the same reason.  An ordinary comment
    (``<!-- TODO: later -->``) is deliberately left alone: swallowing every
    comment would delete document content on the strength of a guess, and that
    block carries a comment anchor like any other.
