    ``block_id`` is ``sha256(normalized raw)[:16]`` plus a 1-based occurrence
    suffix.  The suffix is unconditional rather than only on duplicates: if the
    first copy of a repeated block were bare and only later copies numbered,
    pasting a second copy anywhere in the file would renumber the first one and
    detach its comments.

    Numbering is positional, so it says nothing durable about *which* copy of a
    repeated block it names: deleting the first copy, or inserting a fresh one
    above the others, renumbers everything after it and swaps those comments
    over.  Marp ``---`` slide separators are the real instance.  ``block_context``
    is what tells the copies apart instead (#467): the digest of the nearest
    preceding block whose text differs, or ``""`` at the start of the document.

    Context is carried *beside* the id rather than folded into it, and the id is
    unchanged from #465.  An id that hashed its surroundings would move whenever
    those surroundings were edited, so rewording one paragraph would detach the
    comments on the next; and making the suffix conditional on a block having
    copies would re-identify it the moment a copy appeared, which is what the
    unconditional suffix above exists to prevent.  Both are commoner edits than
    reordering identical blocks, so context stays a tiebreak between blocks that
    are already identical and is invisible to every block whose text is unique.

    Identical *neighbours* are skipped when looking back, so a run of adjacent
    copies shares one context.  The case for it is a *deletion* inside a
    two-copy run (#494 item 3), which is what
    ``test_deleting_the_copy_above_keeps_the_run_tails_comment_attached``
    pins.  In the document that test writes: the survivor still records the
    context the comment stored, and the copy elsewhere in the document records
    a different one, so the comment is placed on the survivor.  Take the
    context from the identical neighbour instead and the tail stores the digest
    of the copy above it, which no survivor records at all; the context match
    is empty, resolution falls through to the occurrence number the deletion
    has just retired, and the comment is reported detached although its
    paragraph is still in the file.

    Both of those are that document's outcomes, and the scope stated below is
    not enough to generalize them: each has counterexamples *inside* that scope
    (#499).  What decides them is which other copies the document holds — a
    copy elsewhere recording the same context as the run makes the context
    match non-unique again, so the ordinal decides instead of the context, and
    an ordinal that some surviving copy still answers to leaves the comment
    attached, to that copy, where here it is detached.

    That case, and not a general guarantee (#539 review).  Neither rule
    dominates the other.  Every comparison below is made on the shape the test
    writes — a document whose *only* run of two or more copies of the text is
    the one being edited, isolated copies elsewhere allowed.  A second run of
    that text breaks each *rule* in turn and in both directions, so none of
    this is an ordering; it is why the choice rests on the case with a test
    behind it rather than on a count of hypotheticals.  (Each rule, not each
    comparison below: the head-of-run insertion is broken by nothing, second
    run or not.)

    Within that shape, the argument above runs backwards on a longer run:
    delete the copy above the tail of a *three*-copy run and the shared context
    matches both survivors, so the match is not unique and the stored ordinal is
    all that is left — it detaches the comment, or, where an isolated copy later
    in the document keeps that ordinal alive, silently moves it onto that
    unrelated copy, while the per-neighbour context would have named the
    survivor exactly.  Insertion at the head of a run is decided by neither *for
    a comment on that run* (three independent enumerations, no case) — the
    *head* copy's comment lands on the newcomer either way, a comment further
    down the run lands on the copy above it either way.  An insertion that
    *splits* the two-copy run is the case that runs against the skip: wherever
    the two rules disagree there, the per-neighbour context is the one that is
    right.  Split a longer run and even that reverses — split immediately above
    the tail of a three-copy run and the skip resolves the comment correctly
    while the per-neighbour context misses it by two paragraphs.
